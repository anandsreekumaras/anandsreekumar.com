            <h1>Remote Code Execution via Dependency Confusion</h1>
        </header>

        <p>The following write-up details how I discovered a dependency confusion vulnerability on a HackerOne private program, leading to remote code execution.</p>

        <p>Let's refer to the organization as <strong>orgxyz</strong>.</p>

        <p>While running fuff on one of orgxyz's subdomains, I stumbled upon a disclosed <code>package-lock.json</code> file, specifically <code>engineering.orgxyz.com/package-lock.json</code>.</p>

        <img src="/images/writeup/pkglck.png" alt="Package Lock File">

        <p>The file contained over 100 packages, sparking the idea to test for dependency confusion.</p>
        <p><i>What is dependency confusion? <p>Dependency confusion, also known as "substitution attacks," is a sneaky tactic hackers use to trick developers. They upload malicious code to public libraries, pretending it's a trusted internal one. When developers use these libraries, they accidentally download the harmful code. It's like getting fake medicine instead of the real thing. </p> <a href="https://medium.com/@alex.birsan/dependency-confusion-4a5d60fec610">Read more...</a></i></p>

        <p>Thus, the challenge was to identify missing NPM packages. Fortunately, the <code>package-lock.json</code> included NPM registry URLs, prompting me to ping each URL to detect missing packages.</p>

        <img src="/images/writeup/regurls.png" alt="urls">

        <p>I sought assistance from ChatGPT to obtain a Bash script that would provide the status code after visiting each URL. A 404 status code indicated a missing package, notably <strong>orgxyz-css-1.0.4.tgz</strong>.</p>

        <p>Hosting the package <strong>orgxyz-css-1.0.4</strong> on NPM with a higher version could potentially lead to an internal application or server within orgxyz inadvertently executing my code.</p>

        <h2>Next steps:</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Create an account on npmjs.com.</li>

            <li>Develop an <code>index.js</code> script to send a ping back to a canary token or Burp collaborator URL if executed.</li>
            <img src="/images/writeup/indexjs.png" alt="index.js file">
            <li>Compose a <code>package.json</code> specifying the missing package name. Ensure to use a higher package version for automatic pull.</li>

            <img src="/images/writeup/pkgjson.png" alt="Package.json">

            <li>Publish the package and await triggered canary tokens.</li>

            <li>About three hours later, I received an email notification confirming the execution of my code on orgxyz's system.</li>

            <img src="/images/writeup/cantoken.png" alt="Canary Token Triggered">

            <li>Next morning, I decided to compose another <code>index.js</code> file to execute system commands and extract information, forwarding them to a Burp collaborator URL.</li>

            <li>Uploaded the new <code>index.js</code> and monitored responses on my Burp collaborator. Ping backs with command execution outputs were received approximately an hour later.</li>
<img src="/images/writeup/collaburl2.png" alt="Canary Token Triggered">
            <li>Upon verifying all details, report the vulnerability to the private program. Draft the report and send it once the issue is resolved, resulting in a bounty award.</li>

            <!-- <img src="/images/writeup/h1pgm.png" alt="Bounty Awarded"> -->
        </ol>

        <h2>Timeline:</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>March 10, 2024 - Discovery of missing package</li>
            <li>March 14, 2024 - Reporting the issue via HackerOne after reproducing the bug</li>
            <li>March 23, 2024 - Issue resolution and bounty award</li>
        </ul>
